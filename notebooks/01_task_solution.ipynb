    "### 1.1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Battery lifetime prediction\n",
    "Battery lifetime prediction refers to the estimation of the remaining useful life of a battery based on various factors such as charge-discharge cycles, temperature, and usage patterns. Accurate prediction is crucial for optimizing battery usage, preventing unexpected failures, and maximizing the overall lifespan of energy storage systems. The opportunities lie in developing advanced predictive algorithms, incorporating real-time data, and leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy. It can lead to improved battery management strategies, reduced maintenance costs, and increased reliability in various applications, from electric vehicles to renewable energy storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Battery failure detection\n",
    "Battery failure detection involves identifying abnormalities or malfunctions in a battery system that may lead to a loss of performance, capacity, or safety issues. A machine learning algorithms trained on past failures can help in detecting early signs of battery degradation or faults. A robust failure detection systems can enhance the safety and reliability of batteries in electric vehicles, and ultimately extending the overall lifespan and performance of battery systems.\n",

    "### 1.2 Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "#### 1.2.1. Anomaly detection\n",
    "Anomaly detection in electric vehicle (EV) batteries involves identifying abnormal behavior or deviations from expected performance in the battery system. Distinguishing between benign fluctuations and serious faults is critical. Unsupervised learning is essential in this context because anomalies in EV battery behavior can be diverse and may evolve over time, making it challenging to have a comprehensive labeled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2. Segmentation of battery operating condition\n",
    "The electric vehicle batteries will operate in a different conditions related to environment (temperature, humidity, etc), load (passanger, terrain (mountain, plain), usage (long distance, short distance), operating characteristics ( discharge rate, state of health), etc. Clustering methods will be useful in identifying patterns  in the battery operating conditions.

    "## 3. Why do you have n-fold cross validation to evaluate models?\n",
    "n-fold cross validation is used for assesment of performance of the models, and it is done by dividing the data into n equal folds. Then n models are iterative trained on n-1 fold and the remain 1 fold is used for testing. It provides a robust estimate of how well a model generalizes to new, unseen data. There by helping to detecting overfitting by providing a more realistic estimate of a model's performance on new data. It is used to compare different machine learning algorithm and/or to tune the hyper parameters of a model.\n",
